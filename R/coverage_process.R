#' Processing coverage
#'
#' @description The set of functions prefixed with "coverage_" are used to
#'   process coverage data. They are designed to be run after you have processed
#'   your junctions in the order `coverage_norm`, `coverage_score`. Or,
#'   alternatively the wrapper function `coverage_process` can be used to run
#'   the 2 functions stated above in one go. For more details of the individual
#'   functions, see "Details".
#'
#' @details `coverage_process` wraps all "coverage_" prefixed functions in
#'   [dasper]. This is designed to simplify processing of the coverage data for
#'   those familiar or uninterested with the intermediates.
#'
#'   `coverage_norm` obtains regions of interest for each junction where
#'   coverage disruptions would be expected. These consist of the intron itself
#'   the overlapping exon definitions (if ends of junctions are annotated),
#'   picking the shortest exon when multiple overlap one end. If ends are
#'   unannotated, `coverage_norm` will use a user-defined width set by
#'   `unannot_width`. Then, coverage will be loaded using
#'   \href{https://github.com/ChristopherWilks/megadepth}{megadepth} and
#'   normalised to a set region per junction.  By default, the boundaries of
#'   each gene associated to a junction are used as the region to normalise to.
#'
#'   `coverage_score` will score disruptions in the coverage across the
#'   intronic/exonic regions associated with each junction. This abnormality
#'   score generated by `score_func` operates by calculating the deviation of
#'   the coverage in patients to a coverage across the same regions in controls.
#'   Then, for each junction it obtains the score of the region with the
#'   greatest disruption.
#'
#' @inheritParams junction_annot
#' @inheritParams junction_score
#'
#' @param unannot_width integer scalar determining the width of the region to
#'   obtain coverage from when the end of of a junction does not overlap an
#'   existing exon.
#' @param coverage_paths_case paths to the BigWig files containing the coverage
#'   of your case samples.
#' @param coverage_paths_control paths to the BigWig files for control samples.
#' @param coverage_chr_control either "chr" or "no_chr", indicating the
#'   chromosome format of control coverage data. Only required if the
#'   chromosome format of the control BigWig files is different to that of your
#'   cases.
#' @param load_func a function to use to load coverage. Currently only for
#'   internal use to increase testing speed.
#' @param bp_param a
#'   [BiocParallelParam-class][BiocParallel::BiocParallelParam-class] instance
#'   denoting whether to parallelise the loading of coverage across BigWig
#'   files.
#' @param norm_const numeric scaler to add to the normalisation coverage to
#'   avoid dividing by 0s and resulting NaN or Inf values.
#' @param coverage list containing normalised coverage data that is outputted
#'   from [coverage_norm].
#'
#' @return
#'   junctions as
#'   [SummarizedExperiment][SummarizedExperiment::SummarizedExperiment-class]
#'   object with additional `assays` named "coverage_region" and
#'   "coverage_score". "coverage_region" labels the region of greatest
#'   disruption (1 = exon_start, 2 = exon_end, 3 = intron) and "coverage_score"
#'   contains the abnormality scores of the region with the greatest disruption.
